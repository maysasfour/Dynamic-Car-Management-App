Dynamic Car Management Application ðŸš—

About This Project
This is my implementation of the Dynamic Car Management Application assignment. The project demonstrates my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by creating a fully functional web application for managing car records dynamically. The app includes features like adding car details, displaying them in a user-friendly format, deleting records, and toggling between Left-to-Right (LTR) and Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts.

Features
Add Car Details
A form to input Make, Model, and Year of cars.
Car details are saved as objects in an array when submitted.
Dynamic Display of Cars
Car records are displayed dynamically in a clean format (e.g., cards or a list).
Each record includes a Delete button to remove it from the array and the display.
RTL and LTR Layout Toggle
A toggle button allows switching between LTR (English) and RTL (Arabic) layouts.
Automatically updates the text direction and language dynamically.
Responsive and Modern UI
Clean, responsive design for seamless usability across devices.
Hover effects and polished visuals enhance the user experience.
Optional Enhancements I Worked On ðŸŒŸ
In addition to the core requirements, Iâ€™ve added:

Data Persistence: Used localStorage to save the car array, ensuring data is retained across page reloads.
Input Validation: Added validation to ensure the year is a valid number and all fields are filled correctly.
Styling Enhancements: Included animations and improved responsiveness.
